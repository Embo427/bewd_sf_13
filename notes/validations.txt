when saving things to database, you may want to make sure that

- certain things are not blank
  - i.e. required field, like email address
- data types match
- uniqueness
  - validates :name, uniqueness: {scope: :year}
    - i.e. valedictorian, year 2016. can only have one per year

Searching
Artist.where(name: 'Haim').first - need to add first b/c it's an array
Artist.find_by_name('Haim')

Adding new things to models
rails g migration add_active_to_artists active:boolean fake:text
  - check the migration file
  - can change in the migration file if need be
rake db:migrate
