scalar objects represent a single value
double quotes allow you to insert ruby variables into a string. aka interpolation

variable.class - tells you the variable type

variable = _ assigns variable to the "last thing"
i.e. if I create Array.new without assigning it to anything, i can do:
array = _ to grab that last array and assign it

<< shovel is only designed to receive 1 object
push can pass multiple items
